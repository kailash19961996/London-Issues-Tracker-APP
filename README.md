# London Issues Tracker

## Project Overview
The London Issues Tracker is an interactive platform designed to engage community members and policymakers in addressing key urban challenges. This project, developed for a hackathon organized by 'Future House' with contributions from policymakers and tech enthusiasts, leverages artificial intelligence to efficiently process and analyze user-submitted reports, providing valuable insights into urban issues.

## AI Integration

This project heavily relies on two AI models to enhance its functionality:

1. **Classification Model**: Automatically categorizes user reports into predefined urban issue categories (e.g., Graffiti, Garbage, Broken Windows, Green Spaces, Public Buildings, Sports and Social Events).

2. **Summarization Model**: Generates concise summaries of user comments for each category, providing quick insights, especially when dealing with a large volume of reports.

## Objectives

- Enhance urban aesthetics
- Improve community health and well-being
- Promote sustainability in urban environments
- Ensure safety in public spaces

## How to Contribute

- Submit reports of urban issues in your area
- Verify and validate reports submitted by others
- Engage with local authorities to address identified issues

## Future Development Ideas

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement an AI model to analyze the sentiment of user comments, providing insights into public opinion on various urban issues.

2. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop AI algorithms to predict potential urban issues based on historical data and environmental factors.

3. **Chatbot Integration**: Create an AI-powered chatbot to assist users in submitting reports and answering frequently asked questions.

4. **Image Recognition**: Enhance the AI capabilities to automatically detect and classify urban issues from uploaded images.

5. **Multilingual Support**: Implement AI-based translation to make the platform accessible to a diverse user base.

6. **Gamification**: Introduce AI-driven challenges and rewards to encourage user engagement and participation.

7. **Automated Reporting**: Develop AI algorithms to generate comprehensive reports for policymakers, highlighting critical areas of concern.

8. **Issue Resolution Tracking**: Implement an AI system to track and predict the time and resources required for issue resolution based on historical data.

9. **Collaboration Features**: Add AI-powered recommendation systems to connect users working on similar urban issues.

10. **Data Anonymization**: Implement AI techniques to ensure user privacy while maintaining data utility for analysis and reporting.

## Summary
This app gives users the ability to report issues or suggestions and see what kinds of issues or suggestions people around them are making and how things are changing over time. This transparency is key to engaging the community.

On the other side, it gives policymakers a unique opportunity to see the bigger picture, helping them decide which problems are critical and allocate resources accordingly.
